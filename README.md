vehicle components and vehicle dynamics WS2022/2023 - Simulate Breaking Distance Project

The user run the file and see a GUI.
First steps to follow in order to use the GUI:
1) Step 1: introduce the velocity of the vehicle
2) Step 2: select road type
3) Step 3: select the respected road condition to the desired road type
4) Step 4: define an road inclination 

Steps to perform a brake simulation: 
1) Step 1: press SIMULATION button, which start to plot the vehicle position (starting from 0 meters) and vehicle velocity (m/s)
2) Step 2: press BRAKE button to start the brake simulation => GUI displays the total brake distance and the total time to brake 
3) Step 3: press CLEAR button to delete the ploted garphs
4) Step 4: change the parameters to perform a new simulation

It is possible to export the graphs into .png files, which will be stored in the same folder where the scripts are saved.
